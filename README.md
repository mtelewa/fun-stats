## Design

### Color Scheme

The colors chosen were based on pantone colot palette like [this](https://icolorpalette.com/color/pantone-10239-c). This was inspired by the "Extraterrestrial" color palette in the book "Color Harmony" by Leatrice Eiseman. The colors are to represent a deep dive into each category, also an increasing level of difficulty as the user progresses.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts. The three main fonts used across the website are

* [Segwick Ave](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sedgwick+Ave)
* [Platypi](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Platypi)
* The `Indie Flower` font was inspired by [this page on Medium](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/10-best-script-and-handwritten-google-fonts-afc4b77fdb0c)

These fonts were chosen to convey the playful nature of the website since it is a quiz. Also, I wanted to deliver this hand-written feeling to attract users from different ages.
